<h1 style="color: #FCBF49; text-align: center;">My Gentle Harp</h1>
<h2 style="color: #FCBF49; text-align: center;">By Thomas Moore</h2>
<p style="color: #FCBF49; text-align: center;">  My gentle harp, once more I waken <br>
        The sweetness of thy slumbering strain;
    In tears our last farewell was <br> taken,
        And now in tears we meet again.
    No light of joy hath o'er thee broken,
        But, like those Harps whose <br> heavenly skill
    Of slavery, dark as thine, hath spoken,
        Thou hang'st upon the willows still.</p>     
<p style="color: #FCBF49; text-align: center;"> And yet, since last thy chord resounded,
        An hour of peace and triumph came,
    And many an ardent <br> bosom bounded
        With hopes--that now art turned to shame.
    Yet even then, while <br> Peace was singing
        Her halcyon song o'er land and sea,
    Tho' joy <br> and hope to others bringing,
        She only brought new tears to thee.</p>
	<p style="color: #FCBF49; text-align: center;">   Then, who can ask for notes of pleasure,
        My drooping Harp, from chords like thine?
    Alas, the lark's gay<br> morning measure
        As ill would suit the swan's decline!
    Or how shall I, who love, who bless<br> thee,
        Invoke thy breath for Freedom's strains,
    When even the wreaths <br> in which I dress thee,
        Are sadly mixt--half flowers, half chains?</p>
		<p style="color: #FCBF49; text-align: center;">  But come--if yet thy frame can borrow
        One breath of joy, oh, breathe for me,
    And show the world,<br> in chains and sorrow,
        How sweet thy music still can be;
    How gaily, even mid gloom <br> surrounding,
        Thou yet canst wake at pleasure's thrill--
    Like <br>Memnon's broken image sounding,
        Mid desolation tuneful still!</p>
